# Forecasting net prophet

This repository contains the code for a jupyter notebook with data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. I used text and comments to document findings, and answered the question prompts in the instructions. I found out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

## Technologies
The application is written in Python 3.9.7 and uses the following libraries:

hvplot
pandas
Prophet
datetime
holoviews
matplotlib


The application runs from the command line on Windows, Linux or Mac OS systems, or from the Anaconda Navigator Software.

## Installation Guide

PLease refer to Jupyter Notebook installation guide: https://jupyter.org/install.



## Usage
In the command line go to the folder containing the jupyter notebook. Run `jupyter notebook` to start the jupyter notebook. Alternatively, open Anaconda Navigator, click on "Launch Jupyter Notebook" to start the jupyter notebook.
